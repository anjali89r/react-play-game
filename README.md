How to Play:

This is an build in-browser math game for kids.
When the game starts, you get a random number of stars between 1 and 9,
along with that, you have the set of numbers in the bottom frame that you can use. You can select one or more numbers that
would sum up to the value of the random stars. The aim is to correctly use all the numbers in the
bottom frame. If one end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct combination, you get to redraw,
which you can do five times. After that, if you still end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct
combination out of all the remaining numbers, then you lose the game.
